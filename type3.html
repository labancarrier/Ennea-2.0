It was named personality type Three The Achiever because when they are healthy, Threes really can and do accomplish great things in the world. They are the "stars" of human nature, and people often look up to them because of their graciousness and personal achievements. Healthy Threes know how good it feels to develop themselves and contribute their abilities to the world, and also enjoy encouraging others to greater personal achievements than others thought they were capable of. They are generally well viewed and popular among their peers, the type of person who is often voted “class president" or “homecoming queen” because people feel they want to be associated with this type of person who acts as a stand-in for them. Healthy Threes embody the best in a culture, and others are able to see their hopes and dreams reflecting in them.</p>

                    <h2>Type 3 Found in the Bible</h2>
    
                    <p>Jacob is also known as “the deceiver.” he is shown to be cunning, able to win people over, and effective at what he does. He knows exactly how to deceive his father to receive his blessing.
<br><br>
                            Threes are known for wearing all sorts of different masks to get what they want or need out of the various situations, and we see Jacob do that very thing several times. Jacob also shows his great ability to focus on tasks and be highly productive when he falls in love and needs to work for seven years in order to marry Rachel. He exemplifies determination and efficiency that threes embody. This story is an interesting one, where Jacob is said to have wrestled with God. we see three qualities in both jacobs capacity, his persistence, and his boldness in seeking a blessing.
                            <br><br>
                            He is left with a literal limp like how many threes need similar significant encounters to be humbled and reminded of who they are meant to be.

                    <h2>Type 3 Common Sins</h2>
    
                    <p> <strong>Deceit-</strong> 

                            When Three’s fall into chasing after what will prove themselves and make them successful over chasing what will improve themselves and truly inspire others, they can begin to deceive themselves and lose sight of why they are doing what they are doing. Rather than resting in the truth that they are worthy of the love of Christ, they look for the fulfillment of their true hearts desire in the affirmation of others and gain that by striving after whatever ‘success’ looks in their eyes.
                            <br><br>
                          <strong>Encouragement:</strong>   Your worth never changes, it is not dependent on anything that you do, and it can never be taken away from you. It is something given to you, not gained. Your worth was settled at the cross of Jesus Christ and you get to be an inspiration for others to believe the same. 
                            “Prove me, O Lord, and try me; test my heart and my mind. For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.” (Psalm 26:2-3)</p>

                    <h2>Type 3 Freed in the Gospel</h2>
    
                    <p>Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to enable you to truly know, believe, and trust that Jesus Christ’s life, death, and resurrection perfectly demonstrates how much He values, loves, cherishes, and wants the real you. He did not create you to be someone else. 
<br><br>
                            Embrace who you are and accept Christ's love, knowing you don't have to earn what you already have. This means you can still enjoy accomplishing goals, but for the benefit of others and God's glory.
